This plugin beams in some info from GitHub.

== Description ==

This plugin beams in some info from GitHub.

It's kind of a proof of concept: use wordpress shortcodes to pull in data stored on github.
This would give you a backend api that anyone could use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work yet? =

Shut up.

= Does it make any sense to do this? =

It took me a long time.  So 'yes.'


== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
2. This is the second screen shot
